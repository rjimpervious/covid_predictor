# Covid Forecaster

A predictive model using the data from cases in Germany. ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average) was used to trained the model. The data was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/covid19-tracking-germany). Google Collabs was used for writing this notebook. A more responsive and dynamic graphic representation is available at my [portfolio website](https://www.rjlopez.me/covid_predictor/) using ApexCharts.
